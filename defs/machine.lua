---Because all strings pass through Java at some point it can be useful to handle them with Unicode support (since Java's internal string representation is UTF-8 encoded). In particular, screens display UTF-8 strings, meaning the related GPU functions expect UTF-8 strings. Also, keyboard input will generally be UTF-8 encoded, especially the clipboard.
---***
---However, keep in mind that while wide characters can be displayed, input and output of those is not fully supported in OpenOS's software (i.e. the shell, edit and Lua interpreter).

---A list of methods that component.proxy returns when the component whose ID passed in is a GPU.
---@class GPUProxy : Proxy
--- @field type "gpu"
---  @field bind                 fun(address: ID, reset?:boolean)                                                                                                                                    Tries to bind the GPU to a screen with the specified address. Returns `true` on success, `false` and an error message on failure. Resets the screen's settings if reset is 'true'. A GPU can only be bound to one screen at a time. All operations on it will work on the bound screen. If you wish to control multiple screens at once, you'll need to put more than one graphics card into your computer.
---  @field getScreen            fun()                                                                                                              : ID                                             Get the address of the screen the GPU is bound to. Since 1.3.2.
---  @field getBackground        fun()                                                                                                              : color|integer,boolean                          Gets the current background color. This background color is applied to all “pixels” that get changed by other operations. Note that the returned number is either an RGB value in hexadecimal format, i.e. `0xRRGGBB`, or a palette index. The second returned value indicates which of the two it is (`true` for palette color, `false` for RGB value).
---  @field setBackground        fun(color:color, isPaletteIndex?:boolean)                                                                                                                           Sets the background color to apply to “pixels” modified by other operations from now on. The returned value is the old background color, as the actual value it was set to (i.e. not compressed to the color space currently set). The first value is the previous color as an RGB value. If the color was from the palette, the second value will be the index in the palette. Otherwise it will be `nil`. Note that the color is expected to be specified in hexadecimal RGB format, i.e. `0xRRGGBB`. This is to allow uniform color operations regardless of the color depth supported by the screen and GPU.
---  @field getForeground        fun()                                                                                                              : color|integer, boolean                         Like getBackground, but for the foreground color.
---  @field setForeground        fun(color:color|integer, isPaletteIndex?:boolean)                                                                                                                   Like setBackground, but for the foreground color.

---  @field setPaletteColor      fun(index:integer,value:color)                                                                                     : color                                          Sets the RGB value of the color in the palette at the specified index.
---  @field maxDepth             fun()                                                                                                              : colorDepth                                     Gets the maximum supported color depth supported by the GPU and the screen it is bound to (minimum of the two).
---  @field getDepth             fun()                                                                                                              : colorDepth                                     The currently set color depth of the GPU/screen, in bits. Can be 1, 4 or 8.
---  @field setDepth             fun(bit:colorDepth)                                                                                                : colorDepthString                               Sets the color depth to use. Can be up to the maximum supported color depth. If a larger or invalid value is provided it will throw an error. Returns the old depth as one of the strings `OneBit`, `FourBit`, or `EightBit`.
---  @field maxResolution        fun()                                                                                                              : number,number                                  Gets the maximum resolution supported by the GPU and the screen it is bound to (minimum of the two).
---  @field getResolution        fun()                                                                                                              : number,number                                  Gets the currently set resolution.
---  @field setResolution        fun(width:number,height:number)                                                                                    : boolean                                        Sets the specified resolution. Can be up to the maximum supported resolution. If a larger or invalid resolution is provided it will throw an error. Returns `true` if the resolution was changed (may return `false` if an attempt was made to set it to the same value it was set before), `false` otherwise.
---  @field getViewport          fun()                                                                                                              : number,number                                  Get the current viewport resolution.
---  @field setViewport          fun(width:number,height:number)                                                                                    : boolean                                        Set the current viewport resolution. Returns `true` if it was changed (may return `false` if an attempt was made to set it to the same value it was set before), `false` otherwise. This makes it look like screen resolution is lower, but the actual resolution stays the same. Characters outside top-left corner of specified size are just hidden, and are intended for rendering or storing things off-screen and copying them to the visible area when needed. Changing resolution will change viewport to whole screen.
---  @field get                  fun(x:integer,y:integer)                                                                                           : string, number, number, number|nil, number|nil Gets the character currently being displayed at the specified coordinates. The second and third returned values are the fore- and background color, as hexvalues. If the colors are from the palette, the fourth and fifth values specify the palette index of the color, otherwise they are nil.
---  @field set                  fun(x:number,y:number,value:string,vertical?:boolean)                                                              : boolean                                        Writes a string to the screen, starting at the specified coordinates. The string will be copied to the screen's buffer directly, in a single row. This means even if the specified string contains line breaks, these will just be printed as special characters, the string will not be displayed over multiple lines. Returns `true` if the string was set to the buffer, `false` otherwise. The optional fourth argument makes the specified text get printed vertically instead, if `true`.
---  @field copy                 fun(x:number,y:number,width:number,height:number,tx:number,ty:number)                                              : boolean                                        Copies a portion of the screens buffer to another location. The source rectangle is specified by the `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` parameters. The target rectangle is defined by `x + tx`, `y + ty`, `width` and `height`. Returns `true` on success, `false` otherwise.
---  @field fill                 fun(x:number,y:number,width:number,height:number,char:string)                                                      : boolean                                        Fills a rectangle in the screen buffer with the specified character. The target rectangle is specified by the `x` and `y` coordinates and the rectangle's `width` and `height`. The fill character `char` must be a string of length one, i.e. a single character. Returns `true` on success, `false` otherwise. Note that filling screens with spaces (` `) is usually less expensive, i.e. consumes less energy, because it is considered a “clear” operation (see config).
-- Buffers
---  @field getActiveBuffer      fun()                                                                                                              : integer                                        Returns the index of the currently selected buffer. 0 is reserved for the screen, and may return 0 even when there is no screen.
---  @field setActiveBuffer      fun(index:integer)                                                                                                 : integer                                        Sets the active buffer to `index`. 0 is reserved for the screen and can be set even when there is no screen. Returns nil for an invalid index (0 is valid even with no screen)
---  @field buffers              fun()                                                                                                              : table                                          Returns an array of all current page indexes (0 is not included in this list, that is reserved for the screen).
---  @field allocateBuffer       fun(width?:integer,height?:integer)                                                                                : integer                                        Allocates a new buffer with dimensions width*height (gpu max resolution by default). Returns the index of this new buffer or error when there is not enough video memory. A buffer can be allocated even when there is no screen bound to this gpu. Index 0 is always reserved for the screen and thus the lowest possible index of an allocated buffer is always 1.
---  @field freeBuffer           fun(index?:integer)                                                                                                : boolean                                        Removes buffer at `index` (default: current buffer index). Returns true if the buffer was removed. When you remove the currently selected buffer, the gpu automatically switches back to index 0 (reserved for a screen)

Returns the screen resolution for index 0. Returns nil for invalid indexes
---  @field bitblt               fun(dst?:integer,col:integer,row:integer,width:integer,height:integer,src:integer,fromCol:integer,fromRow:integer)                                                  Copy a region from buffer to buffer, screen to buffer, or buffer to screen. `bitblt` should preform very fast on repeated use. If the buffer is dirty there is an initial higher cost to sync the buffer with the destination object. If you have a large number of updates to make with frequent bitblts, consider making multiple and smaller buffers. If you plan to use a static buffer (one with few or no updates), then a large buffer is just fine. Returns `true` on success.

---  @field maxPacketSize        fun()                                                                                                              : integer                                        Returns the maximum packet size for sending messages via network cards. Defaults to 8192. You can change this in the OpenComputers configuration file. Every value in a message adds two bytes of overhead. (Even if there's only one value.) `number`s add another 8 bytes, `true`/`false`/`nil` another 4 bytes, and `string`s exactly as many bytes as the string contains--though empty strings still count as one byte.
---  @field isOpen               fun(port:Port)                                                                                                     : boolean                                        Returns whether the specified “port” is currently being listened on. Messages only trigger signals when they arrive on a port that is open.
---  @field open                 fun(port:Port)                                                                                                     : boolean                                        Opens the specified port number for listening. Returns `true` if the port was opened, `false` if it was already open. Note: maximum port is 65535

---  @field send                 fun(address:ID,port:Port,...:Sendable)                                                                             : boolean                                        Sends a network message to the specified address. Returns `true` if the message was sent. This does not mean the message was received, only that it was sent. No port-sniffing for you. Any additional arguments are passed along as data. These arguments must be basic types: `nil`, `boolean`, `number` and `string` values are supported, tables and functions are not. See the serialization API for serialization of tables. The number of additional arguments is limited. The default limit is 8. It can be changed in the OpenComputers configuration file, but this is not recommended; higher limits can allow relatively weak computers to break relatively strong ones with no defense possible, while lower limits will prevent some protocols from working.
---  @field broadcast            fun(port:ID,...:Sendable)                                                                                          : boolean                                        Sends a broadcast message. This message is delivered to all reachable network cards. Returns `true` if the message was sent. Note that broadcast messages are not delivered to the modem that sent the message. All additional arguments are passed along as data. See `send`.
---  @field getStrength          fun()                                                                                                              : number                                         The current signal strength to apply when sending messages. Wireless network cards only.
---  @field setStrength          fun(value:number)                                                                                                  : number                                         Sets the signal strength. If this is set to a value larger than zero, sending a message will also generate a wireless message. Also, calls to set the strength that exceed the installed modem's maximum strength will simply set the modem's strength to it's maximum. The higher the signal strength the more energy is required to send messages, though. *Wireless network cards only.*
---  @field getWakeMessage       fun()                                                                                                              : string                                         Gets the current wake-up message. When the network card detects the wake message (a string in the first argument of a network packet), on any port and the machine is off, the machine is started. Works for robots, cases, servers, drones, and tablets. Linked Cards provide this same functionality.
---  @field setWakeMessage       fun(message:string,fuzzy?:boolean)                                                                                 : string                                         Sets the wake-up message to the specified **string**. The message matching can be fuzzy (default is false). A fuzzy match ignores additional trailing arguments in the network packet.

--#region Data Card Docs

---This card can be used to transmit encrypted data to other in-game or real-life peers. Since we are given the ability to create key-pairs and Diffie-Hellman shared keys, we are able to establish encrypted connections with these peers.
--- ***
---When using key pairs for encryption, the basic concept is this
---
---Preliminary Setup:
---
---(The following items are to be done on the RECEIVER)
---Generate a public key (rPublic) and private key (rPrivate).
---**If no automated key exchange, then you'll need to send rPublic to the SENDER manually.
---***
---The SENDER must:
---
---***Read the RECEIVER's public key (rPublic), unserialize it, and rebuild the key object.
---Generate a public key (sPublic) and private key (sPrivate).
---*Generate an encryption key using rPublic and sPrivate.
---Generate an Initialization Vector (IV).
---Convert sPublic into a string with sPublic.serialize().
---***Serialize the data using the serialization library, then encrypt it using the encryption key and IV.
---Serialize and transmit the message, with sPublic and IV in plain-text.
---***
---The RECEIVER must:
---
---Read the RECEIVER's private key (rPrivate), unserialize it, and rebuild the key object.
---Receive the message and unserialize it using the serialization library, then deserialize sPublic using data.deserializeKey().
---*Generate a decryption key using sPublic and rPrivate.
---Use the decryption key, along with the IV, to decrypt the message.
---Unserialize the decrypted data.
---NOTE* In the above, the terms 'encryption key' and 'decryption key' are used. These keys are, byte-for-byte, the same. This is because both keys were generated using the ecdh() function.
---
---NOTE** In the above, it is stated that you will manually transfer rPublic to SENDER. This would not be the case in systems that employ a handshake protocol. For example, SENDER would make themselves known to RECEIVER, who will then reply to SENDER with a public key (and possibly additional information, such as key-length). For simplicity, the following examples will not cover the functions of handshake protocols.
---
---NOTE*** The examples above and below state that you must serialize/unserialize a key or message. In-general, it is good practice to serialize data (especially when in binary format) before you write it to a file, or transfer it on the network. Serialization makes sure that the binary data is 'escaped', making it safe for your script or shell to read.
---
---To send an encrypted message:
---
---```
---local serialization  = require("serialization")
---local component      = require("component")
---
----- This table contains the data that will be sent to the receiving computer.
----- Along with header information the receiver will use to decrypt the message.
---local __packet =
---{
---    header =
---    {
---        sPublic    = nil,
---        iv         = nil
---    },
--- 
---    data = nil
---}
--- 
----- Read the public key file.
---local file = io.open("rPublic","rb")
--- 
---local rPublic = file:read("*a")
--- 
---file:close()
--- 
----- Unserialize the public key into binary form.
---local rPublic = serialization.unserialize(rPublic)
--- 
----- Rebuild the public key object.
---local rPublic = component.data.deserializeKey(rPublic,"ec-public")
--- 
----- Generate a public and private keypair for this session.
---local sPublic, sPrivate = component.data.generateKeyPair(384)
--- 
----- Generate an encryption key.
---local encryptionKey = component.data.md5(component.data.ecdh(sPrivate, rPublic))
--- 
----- Set the header value 'iv' to a randomly generated 16 digit string.
---__packet.header.iv = component.data.random(16)
--- 
----- Set the header value 'sPublic' to a string.
---__packet.header.sPublic = sPublic.serialize()
--- 
----- The data that is to be encrypted.
---__packet.data = "lorem ipsum"
--- 
----- Data is serialized and encrypted.
---__packet.data = component.data.encrypt(serialization.serialize(__packet.data), encryptionKey, __packet.header.iv)
--- 
----- For simplicity, in this example the computers are using a Linked Card (ocdoc.cil.li/item:linked_card)
---component.tunnel.send(serialization.serialize(__packet))
---To receive the encrypted message:
---
---snippet.lua
---local serialization = require("serialization")
---local component     = require("component")
---local event         = require("event")
--- 
----- Read the private key
---local file = io.open("rPrivate","rb")
--- 
---local rPrivate = file:read("*a")
--- 
---file:close()
--- 
----- Unserialize the private key
---local rPrivate = serialization.unserialize(rPrivate)
--- 
----- Rebuild the private key object
---local rPrivate = component.data.deserializeKey(rPrivate,"ec-private")
--- 
----- Use event.pull() to receive the message from SENDER.
---local _, _, _, _, _, message = event.pull("modem_message")
--- 
----- Unserialize the message
---local message = serialization.unserialize(message)
--- 
----- From the message, deserialize the public key.
---local sPublic = component.data.deserializeKey(message.header.sPublic,"ec-public")
--- 
----- Generate the decryption key.
---local decryptionKey = component.data.md5(component.data.ecdh(rPrivate, sPublic))
--- 
----- Use the decryption key and the IV to decrypt the encrypted data in message.data
---local data = component.data.decrypt(message.data, decryptionKey, message.header.iv)
--- 
----- Unserialize the decrypted data.
---local data = serialization.unserialize(data)
--- 
----- Print the decrypted data.
---print(data)

---@param address ID
---@return string[]
function component.methods(address) end

---Gets a 'proxy' object for a component that provides all methods the component provides as fields, so they can be called more directly (instead of via `invoke`). This is what's used to generate 'primaries' of the individual component types, i.e. what you get via `component.blah`.
--- ***
---For example, you can use it like so: `component.proxy(component.list("redstone")()).getInput(sides.north)`, which gets you a proxy for the first `redstone` component returned by the `component.list` iterator, and then calls `getInput` on it.
--- ***
---Note that proxies will always have at least two fields, `type` with the component's type name, and `address` with the component's address.
---@param address ID
---@return proxy
function component.proxy(address)
end

---Get the component type of the component with the specified address.
---@param address string
---@return componentType
function component.type(address)
end

---Return slot number which the component is installed into. Returns -1 if it doesn't otherwise make sense.
---@param address ID
---@return integer
function component.slot(address)
end

---Undocumented
---@param address ID
---@return string
function component.fields(address)

---Tries to resolve an abbreviated address to a full address. Returns the full address on success, or `nil` and an error message otherwise. Optionally filters by component type.
---@param address string
---@param componentType componentType?
---@return ID | nil,string
function component.get(address, componentType)

--- Checks if `have` matches one of the types provided in `...`. If not, it throws an error saying that argument `n` is of the wrong type.
